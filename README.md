# web-server
Ready to use Web Server.


WORK IN PROGRESS.
Use the package at your own risk.

For the moment I'm not creating a general documentation so you will have an hard time using it. But when I will reach a point everything will be explained.

I started the creation of this project because I have free time and wanted to know more about how express.js works and in general frameworks like that. I had an hard time in some tasks since whenever you make a question on StackOverflow will always arrive that smart guy saying: "JUsT uSe exPreSs". But if my goal is to learn, using framework like Express will just hide all the works. If I'm working on a project for a customer obviously I will use a framework since it will be more efficient and stable.

However I'm just a students and I have a lot to learn, so... If you have some suggestions I'm here.
